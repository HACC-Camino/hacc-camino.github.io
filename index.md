## Team History
The members first met in Dr. Carleton (Cam) Moore's class, ICS 414: Software Engineering II, in Spring 2021. Under said class, Jerome originally worked with a team called [Shocking Development](https://shocking-development.github.io/), while the other four worked with  [Hot-N-Code](https://hot-n-code.github.io/). The latter members then decided to continue working together by registering for ICS 491: Special Topics class under Dr. Philip Johnson. Later on, the team decided to invite Jerome on their team and, together, they formed HACCamino.
