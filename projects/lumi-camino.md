## Overview
Lumi-Camino is a web application designed to help individuals track daily COVID symptoms and vaccination status.

See our deployed website here: [Lumi-Camino](https://lumi-camino.meteorapp.com/#/)

See our project here: [Project Repository](https://github.com/HACC-Camino/HACC-Camino)

## Preview
Below are some screenshots of the web application using sample a user account and data.
### Landing Page
Upon entering the site, the user is greeted by the landing page. The landing page provides users the option to sign up or sign in.

### Home Page
Upon logging in, the user is taken to their home page. The page includes a daily status section, daily health check-in form, add vaccination data form, and resources if users want to know about COVID-19 testing or COVID guidance information. The daily status section displays a message about whether the user should or should not go to campus. This message is determined by the user's response to the daily health check-in form.

### Daily Check In
Users should fill out the Daily check-in form before going onto campus. The form checks if users test positive for COVID-19, have COVID symptoms, or have recently been exposed to COVID-19. If the user has any of these concerns, then they cannot go to campus.

### Add Vaccination Data
If the user has taken both of their vaccine shots, they can add their vaccination card to Lumi-Camino. The add vaccination form will ask for the vaccine name, manufacturer lot number, date, and site of the first and second dose.
